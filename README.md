### Face Detection & Recognition
This project is a real-time Face Detection and Recognition System developed using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning (Keras/TensorFlow).
It allows you to collect facial data, preprocess it, train a CNN model, and perform real-time face recognition using a webcam or IP camera feed.

Face detection and recognition are among the most important applications in computer vision.
This project demonstrates:

- **Face Detection** using Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV).  
- **Face Recognition** using a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
- Ability to capture and process **custom face datasets** for training.  
- Real-time recognition from live camera streams.

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Face-Detection-Recognition.git
cd Face-Detection-Recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Collect Data  
Capture 100 face samples per person:  
```bash
python collect_data.py
```

### 4. Preprocess Data  
Convert images into pickle files for training:  
```bash
python consolidated_data.py
```

### 5. Train the Model  
Train CNN (LeNet architecture) and save as `final_model.h5`:  
```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### 6. Run Real-Time Recognition  
Start live recognition using webcam/IP camera:  
```bash
python recognize.py
```
